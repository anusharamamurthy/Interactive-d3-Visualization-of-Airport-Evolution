# Data-Viz-Project
A D3 based visualization that explores the time series data of the air travel over the past 21 years, visualizing the onset of different airports at various locations across the United States. It will also feature the performance of top airlines based on their flight on-time arrivals and departures. Further it will explore the various factors that cause delays and predict them.
